Getting Started
	To begin executing the python script, you must first open the file using a python integrated development environment (IDE) running python 3.10 or later. 
  Once open, simply run the program in the IDE. 

Running the Script
	Once the script has been started, you will see a list of several different query options presented to you numbered 1 though 11. 
  For numbers 1 through 9, select the query you would like to run by typing the matching number of the query you would like, 
  and outputs will be printed to the terminal below as seen in Figure 2.
